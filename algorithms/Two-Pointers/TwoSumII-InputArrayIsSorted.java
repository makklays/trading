/**
 * Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
 * Return the indices of the two numbers index1 and index2, each incremented by one, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
 * The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
 * Your solution must use only constant extra space.
